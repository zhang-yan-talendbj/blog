How do I see the SQL that OpenJPA is executing?

OpenJPA provides configurable channel-based logging, as described in the chapter on Logging. The simplest example of enabling verbose logging is by using the following property in your persistence.xml file:

	<persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	version="1.0">
	<persistence-unit name="example-logging" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">
	    <properties>
	        <property name="openjpa.Log" value="SQL=TRACE"/>
	    </properties>
	</persistence-unit>
	</persistence>
